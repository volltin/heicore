Note for some humor-impaired people: 

- It is simply a joke making fun of one of the well-known (or maybe little-known) browsers. The product does not exist on earth.

- Do not believe it if someone gives you `HeicoreInstallerLatest.exe` and asks you to run it. It's a virus.

- Ignore aforementioned notes if you already have one. Keep the secrets!
